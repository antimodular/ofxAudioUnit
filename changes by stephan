when calling this in your testApp.cpp:
mixer.AudioUnitGetDeviceList();


the console will show something like this:

GetAudioDevices: 5 devices available

Checking device Built-in Microphone
Device[50] name = Built-in Microphone, input channels = 2, output channels = 0

Checking device Built-in Output
Device[40] name = Built-in Output, input channels = 0, output channels = 2

Checking device Soundflower (2ch)
Device[96] name = Soundflower (2ch), input channels = 2, output channels = 2

Checking device Soundflower (16ch)
Device[57] name = Soundflower (16ch), input channels = 16, output channels = 16

Checking device ProFire 610
Device[107] name = ProFire 610, input channels = 6, output channels = 10


you can now use the start function like this:
output.start(107);

at this point the device numbers are not yet neatly sequencial.
